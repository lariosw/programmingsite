Mon Programming is a development practice where the whole team works on the same thing, at the same time, in the same space, and on the same computer. It is a whole-team approach to doing all the work the team does including designing, coding, testing, deployments, and working with the customers, users and other stakeholders.</p> <p>This is an evolutionary step beyond pair programming, and accentuates face-to-face communication, team alignment, collaboration, and self-organizing team concepts of the Agile approach to software development.<br/>Using techniques and ideas such as the "Driver/Navigators" collaboration practice, one-piece flow, sustainable work habits, continuous learning, and a philosophy of "getting along", Mob Programming can be a highly effective approach. Whether done "all day, every day", or in a more limited way for special problems, kick-offs, and learning sessions, it can be a fun way to get work done.</p> <p>Companies and teams all over the world are using this team-based approach for software development. Please join me as I share how the concept got started, some of the benefits, some techniques we use, and some of the problems we\'ve faced and overcome.</p> <p><b>If you are interested in</b><b> investigating, exploring, and trying a way of working that might give you:</b></p> <p>- Shorter lead times?<br/>- Fewer bugs?<br/>- More knowledge transfer?<br/>- Shorter feedback loops?<br/>- Happier co-workers that know each other better?<br/>- A climate in the team that improves our ability to contribute well?<br/>- A decreased need for status and planning meetings?<br/>- An environment of amplified learning?<br/>- An effective way of on-boarding new team members?</p> <p>Sign up today at </p> <p><a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/woody-zuill-mob-programming-event-at-cdk-global-seattle-tickets-31935149893"><a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/woody-zuill-mob-programming-event-at-cdk-global-seattle-tickets-31935149893" class="linkified">https://www.eventbrite.com/e/woody-zuill-mob-programming-event-at-cdk-global-seattle-tickets-31935149893</a></a></p> <p><b>About Woody Zuill</b><br/>Woody Zuill, an independent Senior Agile Consultant, Trainer, and Guide and has been programming computers for 35+ years. As a pioneer of the Mob Programming approach of teamwork for software development he has been sharing presentations and workshops on Mob Programming for conferences, user groups, and companies all over the world. He is considered one of the founders of the "#NoEstimates" discussion on Twitter.<br/>Woody believes that code must be simple, clean, and maintainable so that we can realize the Agile Value of Responding to Change, and that we must constantly "Reflect, tune, and adjust" so we can continuously grow our skills and improve our capabilities.</p>',event_url:"https://www.meetup.com/ChickTech-Seattle-Meetup/events/237587714/",yes_rsvp_count:2,duration:72e5,name:"Corporate Partner Event: Mob Programming Event with Woody Zuill",id:"237587714",time:14872968e5,updated:1486668278e3,group:{join_mode:"open",created:1450764322e3,name:"ChickTech: Seattle Meetup",group_lon:-122.33000183105469,id:19231622,urlname:"ChickTech-Seattle-Meetup",group_lat:47.61000061035156,who:"Members"},status:"upcoming"},{utc_offset:-288e5,venue:{country:"us",localized_country_name:"USA",city:"Seattle",address_1:"South Lake Union 426 Terry Ave N.",name:"Amazon Van Vorst Building",lon:-122.33712,id:18866222,state:"WA",lat:47.622345,repinned:!1},headcount:0,visibility:"public",waitlist_count:0,created:1486003963e3,maybe_rsvp_count:0,description:'<p>Register <a href="https://swiftcloudworkshop.splashthat.com">here</a></p> <p><br/>This a one-day un-conference focused on building apps and networked services with Swift.</p> <p>Swift Cloud Workshop &amp; Hack Day is an all-day un-conference dedicated to building apps and networked services with Swift, brought to you by Amazon, Google, and IBM.
