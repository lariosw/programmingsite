<strong>Code:Life Hub (Capstone Project)<strong>


<strong>Description:<strong>
 Single page application for coders to find meetups by keyword or date via events on meetup.com, search for tech articles on Tech Crunch via keyword and view all code events on meetup.com in a calendar form. The goal of creating this website was to allow coders to go to one central location and look for the events they want to see on the day that they want without having to go through a site that combines multiple types of event types. 
 
 This project is using a AngularJS platform with Sass as the CSS preprocessor. 
 
This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.15.1.
