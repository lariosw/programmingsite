<strong>Code:Life Hub (Capstone Project)<strong>


<strong>Description:<strong>
 Single page application for coders to find meetups by keyword or date via events on meetup.com, search for tech articles on Tech Crunch via keyword and view all code events on meetup.com in a calendar form. The goal of creating this website was to allow coders to go to one central location and look for the events they want to see on the day that they want without having to go through a site that combines multiple types of event types. 

<strong>Installation:<strong>


Installation is the next section in an effective README. Tell other users how to install your project locally. Optionally, include a gif to make the process even more clear for other people.

Usage: The next section is usage, in which you instruct other people on how to use your project after theyâ€™ve installed it. This would also be a good place to include screenshots of your project in action.

Contributing: Feel free to submit a pull request with any additions to the project.
